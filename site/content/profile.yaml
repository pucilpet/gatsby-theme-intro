  about: |
    In my many years of doing business online I have learned how to build everything from the ground up - be it server setup and maintenance or setting up a Prestashop storefront - that’s the advantage of doing everything yourself.

    I am fluent in building scalable solutions using Docker and I also have some experience working with Kubernetes. I enjoy working with Wordpress, Prestashop and Gatsby.
  skills:
    - HTML / CSS
    - Ecommerce solutions
    - Wordpress
  tools:
    - React
    - Gatsby
    - Graphcommerce
